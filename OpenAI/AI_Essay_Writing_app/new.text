Horticulture is the science and art of growing plants for food, fuel, fiber, and landscape restoration and maintenance. It includes the study of plant growth, plant nutrition, plant physiology, plant ecology, and plant taxonomy. Horticulturists are also involved in the design and installation of landscape gardens, public parks, and other green spaces.

The word horticulture is derived from the Latin words hortus, meaning "garden," and cultura, meaning "cultivation." The term horticulture was first used in the 17th century by English writer John Evelyn.

Today, horticulture is practiced around the world, in both developed and developing countries. In the United States, there are more than 100,000 horticulturists employed in the landscape industry, and another 100,000 in the nursery and greenhouse industry.

The science of horticulture has come a long way since the days of Evelyn. Today, horticulturists use sophisticated techniques and technologies to improve plant growth and yield, and to protect plants from pests and diseases. They also work to conserve and restore endangered plant species.

The art of horticulture is also evolving. Horticulturists are using new plant breeding techniques to create more beautiful and resilient plants. They are also using plants to create works of art, such as living sculptures and topiary gardens.

Whether you are interested in the science or the art of horticulture, there are many ways to get involved. You can study horticulture at a college or university, or you can learn on the job by working in a nursery, greenhouse, or landscaping company. You can also join a horticulture club or community garden, or start your own home garden.
