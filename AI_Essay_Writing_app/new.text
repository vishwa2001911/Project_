Since the reform and opening up in 1978, great changes have taken place in China. Forty years ago, China was a very poor and backward country. People were living in poverty and many were starving to death. Today, China has become the second largest economy in the world. The living standards of the Chinese people have been greatly improved.

China has made great achievements in economic development. In the past 40 years, China’s GDP has grown at an average annual rate of 9.5%, and its per capita GDP has increased from US$156 in 1978 to US$8,123 in 2017. China’s economic development has not only lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese people out of poverty, but also made China a major economic power in the world.

China has also made great progress in other fields. In education, the Chinese government has invested heavily in education, and the number of schools and students has increased dramatically. In 1978, there were only 16,500 schools and 9.3 million students in China. By 2017, the number of schools had increased to 700,000 and the number of students had reached 370 million. In science and technology, China has made great strides. China has launched many satellites and built a space station. In medicine, China has made great progress in the prevention and treatment of diseases.

China’s achievements in the past 40 years are remarkable. The Chinese people have made great progress in their economic and social development, and the country has become a major power in the world.
